        <h3><a href="https://edhrec.com/">edhrec.com</a></h3>
        <p>EDHRec is a websited dedicated to a specific gameplay format called Commander for the popular card game Magic: The Gathering.</p>
        <p>I am frequently building new decks and thus use this site for recommendations and ideas.</p>
        <p>You can also reference <a href="https://www.archidekt.com/">archidekt.com</a> which is a deck building tool that helps you keep</p>
        <p>track of your decks and what cards are in them, making it easier to swap out cards/upgrade them.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/?tag=amazusnavi-20&hvadid=381823327672&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12723853372923341213&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9028070&hvtargid=kwd-10573980&ref=pd_sl_7j18redljs_e&hydadcr=28883_11845445&gclid=CjwKCAjwvMqDBhB8EiwA2iSmPN1fjO1LK0G_1JSKwpX9OyUAd6rsdWdQyy8fE1df6uCM9PEnOX3A7BoCDcAQAvD_BwE">amazon.com</a></h3>
        <p>Another frequent online visit of mine. I am always on amazon looking for good deals on videogames, board games, workout equipment, etc. </p>
        <p>I am such a sucker for amazon that I do have an amazon prime membership. Prime has honestly been a big help during the pandemic</p>
        <p>however since it is a risk to leave the house and I can conveniently order the things I need from the comfort of my home and expect</p>
        <p>them within just a couple of days.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">youtube.com</a></h3>
        <p>I am really not a fan of TV programming. I don't find anything on TV to be very entertaining or aligned with my interests.</p>
        <p>That's where YouTube comes in. There are millions of creators on the platform and anyone could find something they are interested in</p>
        <p>on the site, from cars to vidogame content to cooking and to even coding, there is something there for everyone and I consistently have it on.</p>
